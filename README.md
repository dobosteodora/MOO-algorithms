# MOO-algorithms

In this project a solver for composing teams of students in multi-project courses is implemented. The solver is composed of three heuristic multi-objective optimization algorithms (MOPSO, Tabu Search and NSGA-II), each of them optimizing a specific objective function (e.g. average priority and average experience objective), which are documented in the Bachelor's thesis. The user can set the constraints for the team assignment in the UI (i.e. size of the teams, minimum number of devices, minimum number of female students in each team). A test set with anonimmyzed data from students participating in the iPraktikum is included in the project in order to compute assignment solutions and assess their quality.

Considering a set of evaluation criteria (performance, assignment quality and search space criteria), the three multi-objective algorithms are evaluated against each other in the thesis. Also, a comparison to a single-objective approach (Simplex algorithm) for solving the team assignment problem is discussed.
